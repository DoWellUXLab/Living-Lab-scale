# LivingLab Scales API

Welcome to the LivingLab Scales API documentation. The LivingLab Scales API provides a comprehensive set of features and capabilities to help you effectively manage and analyze various types of statistical scales. With these features, you can easily create, configure, and analyze NPS scales, Likert scales, Staple scales, Percentage scales, Percent Sum scales, Guttman scales, and many more.

## Key Features

1. **Create and Configure Statistical Scales**: The API allows you to create statistical scales with specific settings tailored to your requirements. You can choose from 15 different types of scales, including NPS scales, Likert scales, Staple scales, Percentage scales, Percent Sum scales, Guttman scales, and more. By customizing the settings, you can define the scale's appearance, labels, response options, and other visual elements.

2. **Retrieve and Update Scale Settings**: You can retrieve and update the settings of existing statistical scales using the update scale end-points. This feature enables you to make modifications to the scale configuration as needed. Whether you want to change the orientation, update the colors, or modify the labels, the API provides a convenient way to manage and maintain your statistical scales.

3. **Generate Scale Instances**: The API offers functionality to dynamically generate scale instances. You can specify the number of instances to create, and the API will generate unique instances of the selected statistical scale. This feature is useful when you need to distribute the scale to multiple users or gather feedback from a large number of respondents.

4. **Collect Responses to Scale Instances**: With the LivingLab Scales API, you can collect responses to individual scale instances. When a user or respondent interacts with the statistical scale, you can capture their feedback and store it in the database. The API allows you to provide responses, including the instance ID, brand name, product name, and score.

5. **Retrieve Scale Reports and Response Data**: The API enables you to fetch detailed reports and response data for your statistical scales. You can retrieve data for a particular scale using its template or scale name. Additionally, you can access response data for all scales of the same type or retrieve data for a specific scale instance using its unique ID.

6. **Calculate Total Scores**: The LivingLab Scales API allows you to fetch and calculate total scores for all instances of a particular scale using the unique template name. This feature enables you to analyze and aggregate the responses across multiple instances and gain insights into the overall scores.

7. **Custom Configurations**: The API provides functionality to create, retrieve, and update custom configurations for your statistical scales. You can define custom input groupings and scale labels to further customize and enhance the scales based on your specific requirements.
